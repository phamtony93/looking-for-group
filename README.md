# Looking For Group
Looking For Group App - CS361 Spring 2019

Project Group 20 - Randel Emens, Neal Fredrick, Lea Messenger, Tony Pham, Andy Tran

Our project is designed to make planning and searching for events just a little bit easier. Invitations to events are posted and event posters have the ability to curate the members of their group. Events are posted with specific criteria that members must meet in order to even show that they are interested in attending.
